      <description>&lt;p&gt;So I found out while I was in the program that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily for three months. Besides, my insurance would only cover 45 days.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s all good. I got the healing I needed for the time being. Now I&amp;rsquo;m ready to get to work on some awesome projects.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Development projects I was able to do while in treatment:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A javascript CLI app for contacts, compiled with Bun&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;    &lt;li&gt;A Mad Libs clone I call GeekyLibs&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m also refreshing myself on Python. While I had learned that a while back, I never really did anything with it, and I do want to do something with Python.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! Well, interestingly, the same day I made my last post that said I was doing better, I had a bit of a meltdown and crisis later that day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I spent a week in the hospital, and then was recommended for residential therapy at a local treatment program. This program also has an option for transitional housing at the end. This will be great since I&amp;rsquo;m at the shelter right now, and that takes a toll on me as it is. So I get the benefit of therapy and it&amp;rsquo;s a ticket out of the shelter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Had to take a mental health break...</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone! I had hoped to work on certain projects a bit more, but I pretty much needed a mental health break. I had several weeks where it was a struggle for me. So I didn&amp;rsquo;t focus on FearlessCMS or the other projects like I really wanted to.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;January is generally a rough month for me anyway. Perhaps January should just be a month where I largely focus on my mental health going forward for me.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
