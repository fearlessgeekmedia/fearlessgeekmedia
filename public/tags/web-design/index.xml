&lt;p>FearlessCMS has been in alpha for a few weeks now. I never got around to announcing it here. But we&amp;rsquo;re already on Alpha 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I expect to be on Alpha 2 for some time. I want other developers to start trying it out and developing for it. I want to create a good plugin and theme ecosystem for the CMS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also decided to add an export script to export to a static HTML/Javascript site, much like Hugo would create for you, even though it&amp;rsquo;s a full content management system, unlike Hugo.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Plans...</title><link>/post/plans/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>service@fearlessgeekmedia.com (Fearless Geek Media)</author><guid>/post/plans/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="fearlesscms">FearlessCMS&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I am currently working on FearlessCMS, a content management system that I will be using for new clients. I hope to have this in alpha by the end of May. It is a flat-file system, meaning it doesn&amp;rsquo;t connect to a SQL database. It uses markdown and saves to markdown files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel it comes at a pivotal time, considering there is a lot of drama in the Wordpress community. I will continue to support Wordpress-based sites. But I do have to wonder about the future of Wordpress.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
