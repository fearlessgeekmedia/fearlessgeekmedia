      <description>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a new year! And a lot has changed! I have decided to redo my website. Honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s still in progress, but I wanted to go ahead and get something up as I took the old site down several months ago.&#xA;I have started my own new projects, but also looking for new clients in this new year.&#xA;I have made some changes in my life. I have moved to Salt Lake City, Utah!</description>
