      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a new year! And a lot has changed! I have decided to redo my website. Honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s still in progress, but I wanted to go ahead and get something up as I took the old site down several months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have started my own new projects, but also looking for new clients in this new year.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have made some changes in my life. I have moved to Salt Lake City, Utah! It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful city with a thriving technology scene. I do miss Charlotte, but I needed a new start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
