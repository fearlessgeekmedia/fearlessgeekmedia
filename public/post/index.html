<time class=postDate datetime=2025-04-13>April 13, 2025</time></div><div class=postExcerpt><p><h2 id=geekdown-markdown-editor>GeekDown Markdown Editor</h2><p>Yesterday, I published the first release of the GeekDown markdown editor. It&rsquo;s version 0.0.1. This should indicate it is very early alpha software. With that being said, I am using it right now to write this post for the website. So while it&rsquo;s alpha, it is useful in production.</p><p>Definitely do not expect everything to be perfect with this app, however. There are issues I definitely know about it.</p></p></div></div></a><a class=postListLink href=/post/plans/><div class=postListItem role=listitem><div class=postHeader><span class=postTitle>Plans...</span>
<time class=postDate datetime=2025-04-05>April 5, 2025</time></div><div class=postExcerpt><p><h2 id=fearlesscms>FearlessCMS</h2><p>I am currently working on FearlessCMS, a content management system that I will be using for new clients. I hope to have this in alpha by the end of May. It is a flat-file system, meaning it doesn&rsquo;t connect to a SQL database. It uses markdown and saves to markdown files.</p><p>I feel it comes at a pivotal time, considering there is a lot of drama in the Wordpress community. I will continue to support Wordpress-based sites. But I do have to wonder about the future of Wordpress.</p></p></div></div></a><a class=postListLink href=/post/im-back/><div class=postListItem role=listitem><div class=postHeader><span class=postTitle>I'm back, program wasn't quite three months</span>
<time class=postDate datetime=2025-03-30>March 30, 2025</time></div><div class=postExcerpt><p><p>So I found out while I was in the program that it wasn&rsquo;t necessarily for three months. Besides, my insurance would only cover 45 days.</p><p>It&rsquo;s all good. I got the healing I needed for the time being. Now I&rsquo;m ready to get to work on some awesome projects.</p><p>Development projects I was able to do while in treatment:</p><ul><li>A javascript CLI app for contacts, compiled with Bun</li><li>A Mad Libs clone I call GeekyLibs</li></ul><p>I&rsquo;m also refreshing myself on Python. While I had learned that a while back, I never really did anything with it, and I do want to do something with Python.</p></p></div></div></a><a class=postListLink href=/post/update-out-for-three-months/><div class=postListItem role=listitem><div class=postHeader><span class=postTitle>In 3 month residential treatment for mental health.</span>
<time class=postDate datetime=2025-02-13>February 13, 2025</time></div><div class=postExcerpt><p><p>Hi everyone! Well, interestingly, the same day I made my last post that said I was doing better, I had a bit of a meltdown and crisis later that day.</p><p>I spent a week in the hospital, and then was recommended for residential therapy at a local treatment program. This program also has an option for transitional housing at the end. This will be great since I&rsquo;m at the shelter right now, and that takes a toll on me as it is. So I get the benefit of therapy and it&rsquo;s a ticket out of the shelter.</p></p></div></div></a><a class=postListLink href=/post/mental-health-break/><div class=postListItem role=listitem><div class=postHeader><span class=postTitle>Had to take a mental health break...</span>
<time class=postDate datetime=2025-02-03>February 3, 2025</time></div><div class=postExcerpt><p><p>Hi everyone! I had hoped to work on certain projects a bit more, but I pretty much needed a mental health break. I had several weeks where it was a struggle for me. So I didn&rsquo;t focus on FearlessCMS or the other projects like I really wanted to.</p><p>January is generally a rough month for me anyway. Perhaps January should just be a month where I largely focus on my mental health going forward for me.</p></p></div></div></a><a class=postListLink href=/post/new-year-new-site/><div class=postListItem role=listitem><div class=postHeader><span class=postTitle>New Year, New Site!</span>
<time class=postDate datetime=2024-12-31>December 31, 2024</time></div><div class=postExcerpt><p><p>Well, it&rsquo;s a new year! And a lot has changed! I have decided to redo my website. Honestly, it&rsquo;s still in progress, but I wanted to go ahead and get something up as I took the old site down several months ago.</p><p>I have started my own new projects, but also looking for new clients in this new year.</p><p>I have made some changes in my life. I have moved to Salt Lake City, Utah! It&rsquo;s a beautiful city with a thriving technology scene. I do miss Charlotte, but I needed a new start.</p></p></div></div></a></div></div></main></div><footer class=footer><span>© 2025 Fearless Geek Media, Built with
