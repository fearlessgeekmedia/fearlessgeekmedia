Besides, my insurance would only cover 45 days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s all good. I got the healing I needed for the time being. Now I&amp;rsquo;m ready to get to work on some awesome projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Development projects I was able to do while in treatment:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
 &lt;li>A javascript CLI app for contacts, compiled with Bun&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>A Mad Libs clone I call GeekyLibs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m also refreshing myself on Python. While I had learned that a while back, I never really did anything with it, and I do want to do something with Python.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>In 3 month residential treatment for mental health.</title><link>/post/update-out-for-three-months/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>service@fearlessgeekmedia.com (Fearless Geek Media)</author><guid>/post/update-out-for-three-months/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi everyone! Well, interestingly, the same day I made my last post that said I was doing better, I had a bit of a meltdown and crisis later that day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spent a week in the hospital, and then was recommended for residential therapy at a local treatment program. This program also has an option for transitional housing at the end. This will be great since I&amp;rsquo;m at the shelter right now, and that takes a toll on me as it is. So I get the benefit of therapy and it&amp;rsquo;s a ticket out of the shelter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Had to take a mental health break...</title><link>/post/mental-health-break/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>service@fearlessgeekmedia.com (Fearless Geek Media)</author><guid>/post/mental-health-break/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi everyone! I had hoped to work on certain projects a bit more, but I pretty much needed a mental health break. I had several weeks where it was a struggle for me. So I didn&amp;rsquo;t focus on FearlessCMS or the other projects like I really wanted to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>January is generally a rough month for me anyway. Perhaps January should just be a month where I largely focus on my mental health going forward for me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Year, New Site!</title><link>/post/new-year-new-site/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>service@fearlessgeekmedia.com (Fearless Geek Media)</author><guid>/post/new-year-new-site/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a new year! And a lot has changed! I have decided to redo my website. Honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s still in progress, but I wanted to go ahead and get something up as I took the old site down several months ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have started my own new projects, but also looking for new clients in this new year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have made some changes in my life. I have moved to Salt Lake City, Utah! It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful city with a thriving technology scene. I do miss Charlotte, but I needed a new start.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
