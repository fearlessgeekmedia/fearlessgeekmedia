&lt;p>FearlessCMS has been in alpha for a few weeks now. I never got around to announcing it here. But we&amp;rsquo;re already on Alpha 2.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I expect to be on Alpha 2 for some time. I want other developers to start trying it out and developing for it. I want to create a good plugin and theme ecosystem for the CMS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also decided to add an export script to export to a static HTML/Javascript site, much like Hugo would create for you, even though it&amp;rsquo;s a full content management system, unlike Hugo.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>GeekDown Editor</title><link>/post/geekdown/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>service@fearlessgeekmedia.com (Fearless Geek Media)</author><guid>/post/geekdown/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="geekdown-markdown-editor">GeekDown Markdown Editor&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Yesterday, I published the first release of the GeekDown markdown editor. It&amp;rsquo;s version 0.0.1. This should indicate it is very early alpha software. With that being said, I am using it right now to write this post for the website. So while it&amp;rsquo;s alpha, it is useful in production. &lt;/p>
&lt;p>Definitely do not expect everything to be perfect with this app, however. There are issues I definitely know about it.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Plans...</title><link>/post/plans/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>service@fearlessgeekmedia.com (Fearless Geek Media)</author><guid>/post/plans/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="fearlesscms">FearlessCMS&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>I am currently working on FearlessCMS, a content management system that I will be using for new clients. I hope to have this in alpha by the end of May. It is a flat-file system, meaning it doesn&amp;rsquo;t connect to a SQL database. It uses markdown and saves to markdown files.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I feel it comes at a pivotal time, considering there is a lot of drama in the Wordpress community. I will continue to support Wordpress-based sites. But I do have to wonder about the future of Wordpress.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>I'm back, program wasn't quite three months</title><link>/post/im-back/</link><pubDate>Sun, 30 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>service@fearlessgeekmedia.com (Fearless Geek Media)</author><guid>/post/im-back/</guid><description>&lt;p>So I found out while I was in the program that it wasn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily for three months. Besides, my insurance would only cover 45 days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s all good. I got the healing I needed for the time being. Now I&amp;rsquo;m ready to get to work on some awesome projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Development projects I was able to do while in treatment:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
 &lt;li>A javascript CLI app for contacts, compiled with Bun&lt;/li>
 &lt;li>A Mad Libs clone I call GeekyLibs&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m also refreshing myself on Python. While I had learned that a while back, I never really did anything with it, and I do want to do something with Python.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>In 3 month residential treatment for mental health.</title><link>/post/update-out-for-three-months/</link><pubDate>Thu, 13 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>service@fearlessgeekmedia.com (Fearless Geek Media)</author><guid>/post/update-out-for-three-months/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi everyone! Well, interestingly, the same day I made my last post that said I was doing better, I had a bit of a meltdown and crisis later that day.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I spent a week in the hospital, and then was recommended for residential therapy at a local treatment program. This program also has an option for transitional housing at the end. This will be great since I&amp;rsquo;m at the shelter right now, and that takes a toll on me as it is. So I get the benefit of therapy and it&amp;rsquo;s a ticket out of the shelter.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Had to take a mental health break...</title><link>/post/mental-health-break/</link><pubDate>Mon, 03 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>service@fearlessgeekmedia.com (Fearless Geek Media)</author><guid>/post/mental-health-break/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hi everyone! I had hoped to work on certain projects a bit more, but I pretty much needed a mental health break. I had several weeks where it was a struggle for me. So I didn&amp;rsquo;t focus on FearlessCMS or the other projects like I really wanted to.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>January is generally a rough month for me anyway. Perhaps January should just be a month where I largely focus on my mental health going forward for me.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New Year, New Site!</title><link>/post/new-year-new-site/</link><pubDate>Tue, 31 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><author>service@fearlessgeekmedia.com (Fearless Geek Media)</author><guid>/post/new-year-new-site/</guid><description>&lt;p>Well, it&amp;rsquo;s a new year! And a lot has changed! I have decided to redo my website. Honestly, it&amp;rsquo;s still in progress, but I wanted to go ahead and get something up as I took the old site down several months ago.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have started my own new projects, but also looking for new clients in this new year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have made some changes in my life. I have moved to Salt Lake City, Utah! It&amp;rsquo;s a beautiful city with a thriving technology scene. I do miss Charlotte, but I needed a new start.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
