This is a clone of Mad Libs that I created while I was in a mental health treatment program. I was limited in the time I had at the computer but managed to crank this out.

I was inspired by a Mad Libs application that I had with some games on my first computer.

I even created a Template tester and included instructions on how to create templates. You can also submit templates.
