GeekDown is a markdown editor I started working on, partly to familiarize myself more with Milkdown, which I plan on using in FearlessCMS.

Markdown is a language that's popular with notetaking but is also used in various documents and content management systems on the world wide web. Mardown is even used on Github.

Check out GeekDown on the [Fearless Geek Media Github](https://github.com/fearlessgeekmedia/geekdown)
