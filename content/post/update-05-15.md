# FearlessCMS Update
FearlessCMS has been in alpha for a few weeks now. I never got around to announcing it here. But we're already on Alpha 2.

I expect to be on Alpha 2 for some time. I want other developers to start trying it out and developing for it. I want to create a good plugin and theme ecosystem for the CMS.

I also decided to add an export script to export to a static HTML/Javascript site, much like Hugo would create for you, even though it's a full content management system, unlike Hugo.

# GeekDown
No new development has happened on GeekDown but I will be picking that up again soon as I await feedback on FearlessCMS Alpha 2.

# Looking for clients
I am actively looking for new clients, particularly in the Salt Lake City area, but anywhere. We'll be offering a deal soon for those who choose to use FearlessCMS as I do want to test it out with actual clients.
