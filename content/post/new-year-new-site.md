Well, it's a new year! And a lot has changed! I have decided to redo my website. Honestly, it's still in progress, but I wanted to go ahead and get something up as I took the old site down several months ago.

I have started my own new projects, but also looking for new clients in this new year. 

I have made some changes in my life. I have moved to Salt Lake City, Utah! It's a beautiful city with a thriving technology scene. I do miss Charlotte, but I needed a new start.

When it comes to my more personal and spiritual life, I have decided to embrace liberal Quakerism. The ideals of this faith match how I try to live my life. No, I'm not perfect at it, but day by day, I try to live peacefully and simply. And I don't state this to push this faith on any of you. In fact, Quakers generally dont proselitize and force beliefs on others.

I have started new projects, such as FearlessCMS and SkatePass. Both are in progress and code will be posted soon as they will be open source. I have also created a TUI bash script wrapper for XBPS on Void Linux. This code is open source and available on my Github. There are features I've yet to add to it, but I will be adding them when I get back to work on it.

If you'd like to financially support these projects, you can do so on [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/fearlessgeekmedia).

Happy New Year! I expect great things for 2025!
