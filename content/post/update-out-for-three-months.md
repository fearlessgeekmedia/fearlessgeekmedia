Hi everyone! Well, interestingly, the same day I made my last post that said I was doing better, I had a bit of a meltdown and crisis later that day.

I spent a week in the hospital, and then was recommended for residential therapy at a local treatment program. This program also has an option for transitional housing at the end. This will be great since I'm at the shelter right now, and that takes a toll on me as it is. So I get the benefit of therapy and it's a ticket out of the shelter.

The downside: for three months, my internet access will be very limited. I will do what I can on my personal projects, but admittedly it might not be much at this time. I will not be accepting any new clients until June at the earliest. Then, I hope to move into transitional housing and should have more access to internet then.

Thank you all for being awesome! I'm going to at least try to post some art work and writings on my Ko-Fi page. But I can't garauntee that. But thank you for those who have supported me so far. This is just a time for me to heal and deal with the things I've been struggling.

A quote from the short film <i>The Butterfly Circus</i>, "The greater the struggle, the more glorious the triumph."
