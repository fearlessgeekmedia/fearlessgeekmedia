So I found out while I was in the program that it wasn't necessarily for three months. Besides, my insurance would only cover 45 days.

It's all good. I got the healing I needed for the time being. Now I'm ready to get to work on some awesome projects.

Development projects I was able to do while in treatment:
<ul>
    <li>A javascript CLI app for contacts, compiled with Bun</li>
    <li>A Mad Libs clone I call GeekyLibs</li>
</ul>

I'm also refreshing myself on Python. While I had learned that a while back, I never really did anything with it, and I do want to do something with Python.

My high priority project right now is FearlessCMS, with a goal for the first alpha by the end of May.
