Hi everyone! I had hoped to work on certain projects a bit more, but I pretty much needed a mental health break. I had several weeks where it was a struggle for me. So I didn't focus on FearlessCMS or the other projects like I really wanted to.

January is generally a rough month for me anyway. Perhaps January should just be a month where I largely focus on my mental health going forward for me.

Anyway, I'm working on getting back into the swing of things. Thank you to all of you who supported me on Ko-Fi the past month or so! I will have more wallpapers coming for you soon! I intended on having 10 hacker-themed wallpapers and so far, there are only 3. I need to change that. :)

And I'm largely going to focus on FearlessCMS. Considering what's going on in a community for a major content management system, it appears it's best that I make it the highest priority project of mine right now.

I've replaced a little bit of my items that I lost back in July, but I'm largely in need of more clothes right now. I'm a big and tall guy, and the shelter doesn't often get donations of anything my size.

Well, once again, thank you all for your continued support! Be fearless, and code is art!
