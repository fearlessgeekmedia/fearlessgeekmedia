## GeekDown Markdown Editor

Yesterday, I published the first release of the GeekDown markdown editor. It's version 0.0.1. This should indicate it is very early alpha software. With that being said, I am using it right now to write this post for the website. So while it's alpha, it is useful in production.&#x20;

Definitely do not expect everything to be perfect with this app, however. There are issues I definitely know about it.

I've made the source code available under the MIT license at <https://github.com/fearlessgeekmedia/geekdown>. Linux and MacOS packages are available. I could make one for Windows as well, though I'm not a Windows user. Being an electron app, it would be pretty easy to do.

The main reason for creating GeekDown was to get experience with Milkdown, one of two editors that will be used with FearlessCMS. Now that I understand how Milkdown works, I'm more confident in adding Milkdown to FearlessCMS.
