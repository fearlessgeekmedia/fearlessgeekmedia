## FearlessCMS

I am currently working on FearlessCMS, a content management system that I will be using for new clients. I hope to have this in alpha by the end of May. It is a flat-file system, meaning it doesn't connect to a SQL database. It uses markdown and saves to markdown files.

I feel it comes at a pivotal time, considering there is a lot of drama in the Wordpress community. I will continue to support Wordpress-based sites. But I do have to wonder about the future of Wordpress.

## AI Music

A friend recently told me about Suno and paid for a pro subscription for me. So I've been making AI music, mainly punk rock and ska, since that is what I enjoy. It's pretty cool and will actually be working on releasing an album of AI punk and ska music.

## Shell scripts and Weatherfront

I love shell scripting. I've released a number of bash shell scripts the past couple of years. I just released the code to one I called Weatherfront. It's not complete, but it does a pretty good job, I think. It does depend on ansiweather, chafa, and gum, and you should use it in a terminal emulator that supports images, such as Kitty or Ghostty.

## GeekyLibs

I just recently put out a web-based Madlibs clone called GeekyLibs. Check it out at <a href="https://geekylibs.infinityfreeapp.com" target="_blank">https://geekylibs.infinityfreeapp.com</a>.
